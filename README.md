# Carbon-Footprint-Tracker
Browser Extension for tracing Carbon footprint of a userâ€™s mail account. 

The Browser Extension for Tracing Carbon Footprint of Email Accounts is designed to calculate and track the carbon footprint of an email account. The carbon footprint of an email account refers to the amount of carbon emissions generated from the energy used to send and receive emails.

## The Carbon Footprint of Emails
The carbon footprint of emails can add up quickly, especially with the increasing number of emails sent and received daily. One of the main sources of the carbon footprint of emails is the energy used to run data centers, which store and process emails. Data centers consume a significant amount of energy, and the energy used is often generated from non-renewable sources such as coal, natural gas, and oil.

In addition, the carbon footprint of emails also includes the energy used to manufacture, distribute, and dispose of electronic devices such as computers, smartphones, and tablets used to send and receive emails. The carbon footprint of emails contributes to global greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change.

## Reducing the Carbon Footprint of Emails
To reduce the carbon footprint of emails, it is important to use more energy-efficient technologies, reduce the number of emails sent, and use eco-friendly electronic devices. Data centers consume a large amount of energy to power and cool servers, storage systems, and other equipment. The carbon footprint of data centers can be significant, as the energy used in these facilities is often generated from non-renewable sources such as coal, natural gas, and oil.
